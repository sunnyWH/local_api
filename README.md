### LOCAL_API

This repository will hold code for testing the new localAPI functions. It will also come to hold our new algos with time. The first step is to get Monkey running on this platform before attempting to bring v2 over from TT.

The first level README in `NinjaApiClient` contains information on how to start and run the client using poetry. 

The second level README in `ninja_api_client` contains general information on methods within the classes.
